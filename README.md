# Project-Template-
This is a generic template for the projects.


- The project description, including the title and its brief overview, how to run the code etc., should be described here.


- Define the dependencies (requirements) of your project/package in "requirement.txt" file. 
So that later one can install them using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

- Do NOT push in the main branch.
