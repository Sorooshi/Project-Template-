# Project-Template-
This is a generic template for the projects.


- The project description, including the title and its brief overview, should be described here.

- In principle one should be able to run your code and pass the necessary arguments using the following command:

``` python main.py --arguments=*** ```

- Define the dependencies (requirements) of your project/package in "requirement.txt" file. 
So that later one can install them using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

- Do NOT push in the main branch.
